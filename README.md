# Chess Game Using Alpha-Beta Pruning

A basic Python implementation of a chess game that applies the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** using the **python-chess** library to demonstrate adversarial search and decision-making in game-playing AI.

---

## Overview
This project allows a human player to play chess against an AI opponent.  
The AI evaluates possible moves using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and selects optimal moves based on a simple material-based heuristic.

---

## Key Features
- Human vs AI chess gameplay
- Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Material-based board evaluation
- Adjustable search depth
- Console-based interaction

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- python-chess
- Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

---

## How It Works
The player enters moves in standard chess notation.  
The AI explores possible game states using Alpha-Beta Pruning and selects the best move based on heuristic evaluation.

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreeshtjagga/Chess-Game-Using-Alpha-Beta-Pruning.git
cd Chess-Game-Using-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
python main.py
